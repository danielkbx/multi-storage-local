  "readme": "# node-multi-storage-local\n\n_node-multi-storage-local_ is a provider for the NodeJS module [node-multi-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-multi-storage).\nIt provides saving and reading files to/from the local filesystem.\n\n# Usage\n\nInstall `node-multi-storage-local` and `node-multi-storage`:\n\n    npm install --save node-multi-storage node-multi-storage-local\n    \nCreate an instance of the local storage provider:\n\n    let MultiStorageLocal = require('node-multi-storage-local');\n    let localStorageProvider = new MultiStorageLocal(options);\n    \nand add it to the MultiStorage instance (or create it wit the provider):\n\n    let MultiStorage = require('node-multi-storage');\n    let storage = new MultiStorage({providers: [localStorageProvider]});\n    \n    // or\n    \n    let MultiStorage = require('node-multi-storage');\n    let storage = new MultiStorage();\n    storage.addProvider(localStorageProvider);\n    \nThe options passed when creating a new instance of _node-multi-storage-local_ has these fields:\n\n- `baseDirectory`: The directory where all files are saved. Defaults to the current working directory.\n- `createDirectories`: If set to `true`, all needed intermediate directories are created whenever needed. Defaults to `true`.\n- `flattenDirectories`: If set to `true` all directory hierarchies are flattened to so that there are no subdirectories. \nThis is useful when developing an application. Subdirectory structures are expressed by inserting a â€“ in the file name. Defaults to `false`. \n\nFurther information on how to save and read files, see the documentation of [node-multi-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-multi-storage).\n\n# Hints\n\n- The generated URLs are relative to the base directory. That means that they are still working after this\ndirectory has been moved.\n- When including the _path_ option, `get` and `getStream` consider this is a subdirectory path.",
